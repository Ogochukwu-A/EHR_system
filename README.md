# Title: EHR information system in Health Care.
An electronic health record (EHR) is a digital record of a patient's medical/ health information that is managed by the health care provider over time. It contains all key administrative clinical data relevant to that patient's management by a particular healthcare provider, including patient demographics, progress notes, conditions, medications, vital signs, past medical history, immunizations, laboratory data, radiology reports, insurance information, and even data imported from personal wellness devices. The electronic health record will enhance clinical documentation, health care utilization tracking, billing, and coding, and enable portability or exchange of health records. 
The introduction of the EHR has helped in the transformation of the healthcare system and improve quality of care. It decreases in the frequency of medical errors by improving the accuracy and clarity of medical records. Medical facilities that manage sensitive information about patients must protect it with strong measures, or they risk violating Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy regulations. The EHR software is protected with robust encryption, and physicians, medical assistants, and nurses can gain access to patient data via secure devices such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops.

The purpose of the project is to design an EHR Information system (website) 

### Project Features and requirements
The frontend was built using HTML 5, Bootstrap 5 and JS; The backend is with PHP and MySQL.

### Frontend
Here a brief summary of how  EHR system functions and the services provided. Other informations about the different values and recommendations can be assessed by clicking on the arrow button. 

**Login and Sign-up pages for the healthcare practitioners.**

Here the physician can initiate either a registration as a first-time user or login into his account if he already has one with the option to remember password.
A new entry will be created in the database of users. If an existing user chooses to log in, the database will be checked for the validity of the username with the corresponding password. After the login/signup screen, users are directed to the dashboard page of the website.

**Physician’s Dashboard**

This is the page which shows up after the doctor logs into his account. From this page, he can access the patient page, patient fees and the other pages available to him as a user. Any update the user makes on this page is transmitted over to the database. 

**Patient’s page**
Here, the physician can CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) the patient’s Data. Each physician only has access to his own patients thereby improving data protection and confidentiality of patient data. 

### Backend
Data is transmitted to the MySQL database hosted on Xampp
